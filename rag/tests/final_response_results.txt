Question:
 Predict idle time both for Riveting Machine and Laser cutter for today based on last month values

Context:
 {
Machine name: Riveting Machine
KPI name: idle_time
Value: 1,12
Forecast: True
}

{
Machine name: Laser Cutter
KPI name: idle_time
Value: 0,123
Date: 12/10/2024
Forecast: True
}

Response:
 Based on last month's data:

* **Riveting Machine:** The predicted idle time for today is 1.12 hours.

* **Laser Cutter:** The predicted idle time for today is 0.123 hours (approximately 7.4 minutes).  Note that this prediction is based on a single data point from October 12th, 2024, so its accuracy may be limited.  More data points would improve the prediction's reliability.


Question:
 Predict next week cycles of Large Capacity Cutting Machine 1 based on current trend

Context:
 Today date: 25/11/2024
{
Machine name: Large Capacity Cutting Machine
KPI name: cycles
Value: 1500
Date: 21/12/2024
Forecast: True
}
{
Machine name: Large Capacity Cutting Machine
KPI name: cycles
Value: 5300
Date: 02/12/2024
Forecast: True
}

Response:
 Based on the available forecast data for the Large Capacity Cutting Machine 1, the predicted number of cycles for next week (starting 2/12/2024 and ending 8/12/2024) is significantly higher than the following week (starting 9/12/2024 and ending 15/12/2024).  The forecast shows 5300 cycles for the week starting December 2nd,  and 1500 cycles for the week starting December 9th.  Therefore,  assuming a consistent trend from the provided data (though only two data points exist), next week's (December 2nd-8th) cycle prediction is 5300.  To get a more accurate prediction for subsequent weeks, more data points are needed.

Question:
 Which is most suitable dashboard to visualize energy consumption?

Context:
 Bar Chart  
  - ID: `bar_chart` 
  - Description: Represents data using rectangular bars with heights proportional to the values they represent. It is optimized for comparing discrete values or categories, such as counts, costs, or quantities divided by category.  

- Line Chart  
  - ID: `line_chart`  
  - Description: Displays data as a series of points connected by lines. It is ideal for showing trends over time or relationships between continuous variables, such as energy consumption, temperature variations, or performance over time.  

- Pie Chart  
  - ID: `pie_chart`  
  - Description: Represents data as slices of a circle, where each slice corresponds to a percentage of the total. It is optimized for visualizing proportions or relative distributions, such as the percentage of consumption by machine or cost distribution.  

- Scatter Plot  
  - ID: `scatter_plot`  
  - Description: Displays data as a collection of points on a Cartesian plane. It is optimized for analyzing the relationship between two continuous variables, such as working time and energy consumption, or for identifying outliers and trends.  

Here are three additional types of graphs with their descriptions:

- Histogram  
  - ID: `histogram`  
  - Description: Represents the distribution of a dataset by dividing the range of data into intervals (bins) and displaying the frequency of data points within each bin. It is ideal for understanding the shape, spread, and central tendency of continuous data, such as machine cycle times or temperature readings.  

- Area Chart  
  - ID: `area_chart`  
  - Description: Similar to a line chart but with the area below the line filled in to emphasize the magnitude of values over time. It is optimized for showing cumulative trends or comparisons between multiple data series, such as total production output or energy usage.  

- Stacked Bar Chart  
  - ID: `stacked_bar_chart`  
  - Description: Extends the bar chart by stacking bars for different subcategories on top of each other to show both the total and the contribution of each subcategory. It is ideal for comparing parts of a whole across multiple categories, such as machine downtime reasons or production volumes by shift.

Response:
 The top 3 graphical element IDs best suited for visualizing energy consumption are:

1. `line_chart`:  Energy consumption typically changes over time, making a line chart ideal for showing trends and patterns in consumption.

2. `area_chart`: This enhances the line chart by visually emphasizing the cumulative energy consumption over time.

3. `bar_chart`:  Useful for comparing energy consumption across different categories (e.g., different appliances, departments, or time periods).  While not as ideal for showing trends as the line chart, it is very effective for comparisons.

Response:
 The top 3 graphical element IDs to visualize workfloor productivity are:

1. `bar_chart`:  A bar chart can effectively compare productivity metrics across different teams, shifts, or products.  For example, it could show the number of units produced per team.

2. `line_chart`: A line chart is ideal for tracking productivity trends over time.  This allows for the visualization of improvements or declines in output over days, weeks, or months.

3. `stacked_bar_chart`: This allows for a breakdown of productivity by different contributing factors. For example, it could show the total production time, broken down into productive time, downtime due to machine failure, and downtime due to other reasons.  This offers a granular view into productivity bottlenecks.
