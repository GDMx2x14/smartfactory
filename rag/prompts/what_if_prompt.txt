USER QUERY: "{_USER_QUERY_}"

INSTRUCTION: 
In the CONTEXT section, you are provided with contextual information about machines on an industrial factory floor and their associated Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) variation on a past time window.
The context includes some pairs of computed KPI values, and the output must precisely compare the pair's value for each pair available in the context.

TASK: Based on the provided context, respond to the USER QUERY effectively. For each pair of VALUES within the context:
1. Compare the first computed KPI value with the second one, using the terms **"improve"** for increases and **"decrease"** for reductions. Do not use synonyms such as "change," "rise," or "fall."
2. YOU MUST include Percentage_Difference data on the output as shown on EXAMPLES
3. Each sentence of explicit comparison must start bya a NEW LINE **(`<br>`)**, followed by a dash (`-`). Ensure there is no text on the same line after a point ends.
4. Treat the context as correct without adding unnecessary commentary or phrases like "Here's the response to the query."
5. Reformulate the data rather than displaying it directly, following STRICTLY the schematic example's ANSWER format.  
6. Explain errors in KPI computation and output ALWAYS (if the context does not contain a valid answer), the ERROR logs in User input DATA ERRORS.

FORMAT FOR CONTEXT:  
1. Computed KPI:  
   - Machine_Name: Name of the machine for which the KPI is reported.  
   - KPI_name: Unique identifier for the KPI.  
   - Value: Computed KPI values or an error message if input parameters (e.g., KPI name, machine, time period) are invalid.  
   - Measure_unit: Unit of measurement for the KPI (e.g., percentage, seconds, units).  
   - Date_start: Start date of the KPI computation (DD/MM/YYYY). If Date_finish is NULL, it refers to a single day (Date_start).  
   - Date_finish: End date for aggregated KPI values (NULL if not aggregated).  
   - Aggregator: Aggregation function used (e.g., MIN, MAX, AVG), or NULL if no aggregation.  
   - Forecast: Always false for computed KPIs.
   - Percentage_Difference: percentage difference between the two element of VALUE, usefull for the output

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Never display raw data directly; always reformulate it in your response.  
2. Use the terms "improve" for positive variations and "decrease" for negative variations. Avoid synonyms.  
3. Each sentence must begin with a dash (`-`) and be followed by a line break. Do not place multiple sentences on the same line.
4. Explain errors in computation clearly and concisely.  
5. If Value in computed KPI contains an error message, explain why the request has failed using also the ERROR logs in User input DATA ERRORS.

EXAMPLES:

Question: what would be availability and throughput if the working time for laser cutter had been 20%% higher last 2 weeks?
Context: 
'
[{{'Machine_Name': 'Laser Cutter', 'Machine_Type': 'any', 'KPI_Name': 'availability', 'Value': [0.8882412879962243, 0.9051000914045362], 'Measure_Unit': '%%', 'Date_Start': '2024-09-30', 'Date_Finish': '2024-10-13', 'Aggregator': '-', 'Forecast': False, 'Percentage_Difference': '+1.8979981719092986 %%'}}, {{'Machine_Name': 'Laser Cutter', 'Machine_Type': 'any', 'KPI_Name': 'throughput', 'Value': [0.06197583328561075, 0.052626777890331], 'Measure_Unit': ' # per seconds', 'Date_Start': '2024-09-30', 'Date_Finish': '2024-10-13', 'Aggregator': '-', 'Forecast': False, 'Percentage_Difference': '-15.085001523408915 %%'}}]
User input DATA ERRORS:
- Error: At least one of the request of the user input does not contain any valid kpi to be changed.
'
ANSWER:
If the working time for Laser Cutter had been 20%% higher last two weeks:
<br>-The availability would have improved from 0.89%% to 0.91%%, an increase of 1.9%%.
<br>-The throughput would have decreased from 0.062 #/s to 0.053 #/s, a decrease of 15.1%%.


Question: What would be the operative time for testing machine 1 if the working time was different during last 4 days?
Context:
'
[{{"Value": "Error: Request input not valid"}}]
User input DATA ERRORS:
- Error: At least one of the user input requests does not contain any valid kpi to be changed.
'
ANSWER:
The user input was not valid, input log errors: 
<br>-At least one of the user input requests does not contain any valid kpi to be changed.

P.S:
DO NOT repeat exactly _USER_QUERY_ at the start of the ANSWER
