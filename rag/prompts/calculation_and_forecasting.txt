USER QUERY: "{_USER_QUERY_}"

INSTRUCTION: 
In the CONTEXT section you are provided with contextual information about machines on an industrial factory floor and their associated Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). The context includes computed KPI values or forecasted KPI predictions.

TASK: Based on the provided context, respond to the USER QUERY effectively. Your response must:  
1. Treat the context as correct without adding unnecessary commentary or phrases like "Here's the response to the query."
2. Clearly distinguish between computed and forecasted KPI values, reformulating the data rather than displaying it directly.  
3. Explain errors in KPI computation and forecasting and output ALWAYS (if the context does not contain a valid answer), the ERROR logs in User input DATA ERRORS.

FORMAT FOR CONTEXT:  
1. Computed KPI:  
   - Machine_Name: Name of the machine for which the KPI is reported.  
   - KPI_name: Unique identifier for the KPI.  
   - Value: Computed KPI value or an error message if input parameters (e.g., KPI name, machine, time period) are invalid.  
   - Measure_unit: Unit of measurement for the KPI (e.g., percentage, seconds, units).  
   - Date_start: Start date of the KPI computation (DD/MM/YYYY). If Date_finish is NULL, it refers to a single day (Date_start).  
   - Date_finish: End date for aggregated KPI values (NULL if not aggregated).  
   - Aggregator: Aggregation function used (e.g., MIN, MAX, AVG), or NULL if no aggregation.  
   - Forecast: Always false for computed KPIs.  

2. Forecasted KPI:  
   - Machine_Name: Name of the machine for which the KPI prediction is reported.  
   - KPI_Name: Unique identifier for the forecasted KPI.  
   - Predicted_value: Forecasted KPI value or a list of value if forecasting refers to more then one day
   - Lower_bound: Minimum predicted value within the confidence interval for the KPI.
   - Upper_bound: Maximum predicted value within the confidence interval for the KPI.
   - Confidence_score: Numerical value (0-1) indicating the confidence level of the prediction (e.g., 0.95 for 95% confidence).
   - Measure_unit: Unit of measurement for the KPI (e.g., percentage, seconds, units).  
   - Date_prediction: Date of the KPI prediction (DD/MM/YYYY) or a list of date if forecasting refers to more then one day.  
   - Forecast: Always true for forecasted KPIs.  
   - Error_message: an error message in case something goes wrong 

REQUIREMENTS:  
1. Never display raw data directly; always reformulate it in your response.  
2. Always explain errors in computation or forecasting clearly and concisely.  
3. Avoid redundant or generic phrases like "Here is the response to your query." Focus on delivering precise, actionable insights.  
4. If Error_message is not empty in forecasted KPI explain why the request has failed
5. If Value in computed KPI contains an Error message explain why the request has failed using also the ERROR logs in User input DATA ERRORS.

EXAMPLES:

Questions: Can you calculate working time min for laser cutter for last week?
Context: '[{{"Machine_Name": "Laser Cutter", "Machine_Type": "any", "KPI_Name": "working_time_sum", "Value": 326921.0, "Measure_Unit": "s", "Date_Start": "2024-10-07", "Date_Finish": "2024-10-13", "Aggregator": "sum", "Forecast": false, "Percentage_Difference": "-", }}]'
Answer: The laser cutter's total working time last week (October 7th to October 13th, 2024) was 326,921 seconds.

Questions: calculate the total working time for laser cutter from 10/10/2024 to 9/10/2024 
Context: 
'
[{{"Value": "Error: Request input not valid"}}]
User input DATA ERRORS:
- Error: Invalid request date format.
'
Answer: The requested calculation cannot be performed, input log errors:
<br> -Invalid request date format: the date range provided, 10/10/2024 to 9/10/2024, is invalid because the start date is after the end date, please provide a valid date range.
