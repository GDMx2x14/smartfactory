# api branch

This is the branch dedicated to the development of the API Layer. It's currently integrated with the database branch, in order to have a shared environment for setting up the data storage.

## To run

-   To run the service, just run _docker compose up_ in the main directory. This will start all the services and the endpoints will be active to handle requests.

-   Database will be populated automatically when its container gets started
